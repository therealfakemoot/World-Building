# Positive Quasielemental Plane of Radiance
*Plane information for Positive Quasielemental Plane of Radiance*

**Alternate Name:** - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** Beautiful and made of pure color, this plane is of an aching and burning beauty. Radiance is the mixing of the Positive Energy Plane and the Plane of Fire, creating a burning, cleansing energy that glows and burns in painful splendor. Every color can be found glistening in this realm of energy, with colors swirling in a dazzling display. There is a price to witnessing the beauty of this plane, as anyone who visits goes blind from the Radiance unless they can properly prepare for their trek into the plane.

The beings of Radiance must be able to survive the erratic energies of the Positive Energy Plane, as well as the burning heat of the Plane of Fire. This radiance isnâ€™t simply hot, but its blinding beauty is enough to burn out those unworthy travelers who would travel to this plane. The quasielementals who reside here are aloof, even with each other, and rarely choose to make themselves known to outsiders. While the people of Radiance rarely ever leave, several distinct groups reside on this plane.

Brilliant lights blind all creatures who journey here unless they take the necessary precautions to protect their eyes. Those who are resistant or immune to the heat of Radiance, which is dependent on the edition if it is simply fire or radiant damage, can look upon this world without going blind. Others must cover their eyes in thick bandages that can protect their eyes from the intense light of the plane. A common tactic by many is to cast _darkness_ on themselves before they enter the plane, as the spell makes the plane around them just dark enough that they can see without going blind.
