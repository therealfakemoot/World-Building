# Positive Quasielemental Plane of Lightning
*Plane information for Positive Quasielemental Plane of Lightning*

**Alternate Name:** - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** Travelers are greeted with a world alight with lightning and energy. The sky is crowded with black clouds and arcs of lightning. The entire plane smells of ozone while bolts leap from cloud to cloud and touching anything in this world is enough to cause static shock to explode out. A glowing brilliance, known as St. Elmo’s fire, coats everything that visits the plane, giving every creature an electrical brilliance. The biggest secret to survival on this plane is to avoid bringing any metal as even a dagger is enough to attract the elemental energies of this plane, turning the traveler into a lightning rod.

The natives of Lightning are largely lightning elementals, though there are a few others who soar through these storm skies. There are even creatures, the Uun, whose entire life cycle starts and ends in the flash of lightning that arcs through the sky. Many of the creatures found here take on the form of lightning, making it hard to discern what is a living lightning bolt and what is a natural construction of the plane, with many believing that every lightning bolt is sentient and alive. Some outsiders have lived here so long as to understand the dark of this plane, though they are rare and reside in the center of the plane on a small mote of earth.

Arcs of lightning fill this world and any metal immediately begins building up charges and attracting lightning to it. The atmosphere is breathable, though it tastes like burnt ozone with a tang. So long as travelers aren’t wearing metal, they probably won’t get struck by lightning often though certain spells are needed to help ward them from harm.
