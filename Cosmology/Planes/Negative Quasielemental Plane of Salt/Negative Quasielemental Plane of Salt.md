# Negative Quasielemental Plane of Salt
*Plane information for Negative Quasielemental Plane of Salt*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:**  Bridging the gap between the Plane of Water and the deterioration of the Negative Energy Plane is salt. This plane is solely composed of great salt blocks and salt caverns that suck any moisture out of this plane. Even travelers are susceptible as they slowly become dehydrated on this plane, no matter how much water they bring with them. This plane is of an ever draining need, constantly looking to take and quench its never-ending thirst.

For this reason, almost every other creature who calls this plane home either attack these elements on sight or flee. Sandlings, dune stalkers, sandmen, and others have created large settlements and fortifications to act as some defense against these savage elementals, and some can live here in relative peace.

This gasping, leeching plane can never be satisfied. The salt here drains the very atmosphere of moisture, causing outsiders to immediately feel a gnawing thirst that never goes away. Blood spilled is greedily consumed by the plane and once-living bodies soon wither away, becoming instantly mummified by this plane. The two dominant creatures of this plane are the salt quasielementals, though little is known of them, and the facets, though they stick along the border to the Plane of Water.Â 

The elementals are similar to their plane, looking and searching for something to consume, to fill their salt bodies with something. While they can be negotiated with, it must be done quickly and offer something, like a large quantity of water, to slake their thirst. They can never be satisfied though, and so gifts and materials must be constantly supplied to them. The other group, the facets, reside in the caustic brine waters as they begin their plans. They are hoping to attack the Plane of Water, thus growing their empire across the planes.
