# Negative Quasielemental Plane of Dust
*Plane information for Negative Quasielemental Plane of Dust*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** As the Plane of Earth extends towards the Negative Energy Plane, it begins crumbling, losing the cohesion of earth until it drifts like fine dust through the air. Eventually, these minute particles begin separating further apart as one travels closer to the Negative Energy Plane until it is simply an expanse of black. All material breaks down on this plane, given enough time and proximity to the ultimate plane of deterioration.

This plane is actually home to a large variety of creatures who have merged at least a portion of their essence into the plane. From the dust wolves who prowl this layer in vicious packs, to the sandsnakes, dao, xorn, silt weirds, dust mephits, and the dust quasielementals, this plane has more life in it than many of the other quasi-elemental planes. Of all the creatures on this plane, it is the dust quasielementals that make this plane more dangerous than the hazards. The dust elementals seek something, anything, to destroy and kill. Their relationship to the devastation of this plane is complete and they are difficult, if not impossible, to negotiate with.
