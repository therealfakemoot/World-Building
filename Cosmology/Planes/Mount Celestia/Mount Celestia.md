# Mount Celestia
*Plane information for Mount Celestia*

**Alternate Name:** The Seven Heavens
**Alignment:** Lawful good
**Inhabitants:** Aasimons, Archons and Devas Bahamut: The Platinum Dragon Heironeous: God of Valor Moradin: God of Dwarves Yondalla: Goddess of Halflings

**Description:** Countless paladins and saints have ascended here.

Seven Heavens, also called the Seven Mountains of Goodness and Law, was the plane of lawful good alignment, home of the archons. Its seven layers (Lunia, Mecuria, Venya, Solania, Mertion, Jovar, and Chronias) were joined in such a manner that traveling deeper into the plane became an ascending journey, up mountain after mountain for example. Each layer glowed with its own color of soft light and each was unique in terrain. The Seven Heavens were the home of Bahamut, Yondalla, and Moradin Dwarffather. See the main article for information on the seven layers and their denizens.

Mount Celestia, also known by its full name as the Seven Mounting Heavens of Celestia or just the Seven Heavens, is a plane of absolute law and goodness steeped in mercy. This plane is located in the Outer Plane and is the home of archons, paladins, clerics, and pilgrims. There are, as its name implies, seven layers that make up this plane, each one rising higher and higher along a singular mountain, or mountains depending on the edition, until a pilgrim reaches the summit, and the seventh layer.

The layers, in ascending order, are Lunia, Mercuria, Venya, Solania, Mertion, Jovar, and Chronias. Much is known about the lower layers of Mount Celestia, with little information known about the higher layers like Mertion and Jovar, and nothing is known about Chronias for only the truly pure of heart can ever enter this layer, and they never come back down. Pilgrims from all over come to this plane to make the hard journey up the mountain’s slopes, as they ascend the mountain, they pass on to the next layer, but only if they are worthy of passing on. As you climb this mountain, you must become more and more pure, pushing out chaos and evil, for only the best may ever journey up through the layers.

## History

![Manual of the Planes, 2001 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530188097-YZGSPXIUVV8HQH92SG8X/image-asset.png?format=300w)

**Manual of the Planes**, 2001 WotC

Mount Celestia is introduced as the Seven Heavens in the _Manual of the Planes (1987)_ in 1st edition where it also calls this plane the Seven Mountains of Goodness and Law. In 1st edition, there are seven mountains, one mountain for each of the layers. To journey to the next layer, you must climb that layer’s mountain to the summit and then you would cross over the layer to the one above it where you would start at the base of that mountain. In 2nd edition, the name Mount Celestia comes into being as it claims that the Seven Heavens are only heavens for good creatures, for evil creatures this plane would be considered a hell. While 2nd edition describes looking at Mount Celestia from the bottom layer and singing a single mountain, each layer describes the different types of mountains that can be found across the layer and the different peaks across the mountain, 3rd and 5th edition are the only editions to clearly state that Mount Celestia is a singular mountain. 

4th edition strips the seven layers from this plane and there are now seven mountains on a single plane, three of the mountains are controlled by their deity while the other four mountains are won through a type of war game between those three deities. 4th edition still has the idea of spiritual growth and climbing the mountains, and provides easier access to a party of adventurers to see more of this plane rather than just the bottom layer.

## An Outsider’s Perspective

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530294959-GZJJS7V9Y8KJ81O0PMO2/Map2_PLaw2e.png?format=500w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

Journeying to this plane are the pilgrims and paladins who seek to make themselves worthy of ascendancy. These travelers are lawful good or at least are working towards that.

Due to the many layers of this plane, there can be a variety of reasons for coming here beyond seeking purity of body and spirit. The second layer, Mecuria, is the eternal resting place for the knights of good, they rest here for eternity as examples to those who come after of bravery, mercy, and valor; their deeds are carved into their tombs. On the third layer, Venya, are the Green Fields, beautiful and verdant fields of the halflings. On this layer, they tend to their farms and live an idyllic life, their lives filled with the joy of being close to their deity. The fourth layer, Mertion, contains the forges of a great dwarven god, this layer is devoted to crafting the finest weapons and it is said that this dwarven god creates every dwarf in his forges.

## A Native’s Perspective

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530536025-84QABVZ83ICEF63R19JG/image-asset.png?format=500w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

Inhabitants of Mount Celestia are mainly the archons, these are the petitioners of Mount Celestia and they are on a spiritual journey after their death on the Material Plane, or anywhere else on the plane. They form as small orbs of light, known as lanterns, and they begin their journey at the bottom layer, Lunia. As the archon progresses on their physical, and spiritual, journey, they change their forms from lantern archons to hound, warden, sword, and tome archon. A petitioner's goal is to become a hound or better and eventually become one with this plane, this process takes eons to accomplish.

Of course, archons aren’t the only inhabitants on this plane, though they do represent the goal of many and what many are striving for. The halflings, on the third layer known as Venya, reside in a section of that layer known as the Green Fields. Here they live an idyllic life, the land is lush and fertile, the animals that live there are no more dangerous than moles, badgers, and rabbits. The halflings rarely ever leave their small villages, the only reason most would ever leave if it was in defense of their home from invaders.

On the fifth layer, known as Mertion, are the paladins, sword archons, devas, and warriors of Mount Celestia. This is the marshaling grounds where the forces of good and law pray in the morning, practice their fighting throughout the day, and then pray at night before falling asleep. These warriors are in constant training for there will be a day when they are called on to defend Mount Celestia from a demonic invasion or the primordials will rise again or the Blood War will visit this plane. Their training is about the protection of the forces of goodness, law, and mercy, their holy mission is to protect Mount Celestia.

All the inhabitants are trusting and good, though that doesn’t mean that they are naive. Most like to believe that those who visit this plane are virtuous and in many cities, there are no locks. Guards still patrol the cities, with some of the newer guards looking to prove themselves and being quick to question anyone they see as suspicious.

## Atmosphere

Mount Celestia, regardless if it is a singular mountain or seven mountains, has the typical atmosphere found on a mountain. The bottom layer, Lunia, has the normal atmosphere that most are used too. The higher you climb up the mountain(s), and each layer, the less oxygen is present and thus on even the second layer, Mercuria, many pilgrims become giddy and must acclimate to the mountainous climate. As you continue climbing higher and higher up the mountain, you must keep acclimating to the higher regions, though there are no layers that aren’t hospitable.

The weather of Mount Celestia is always nice, with bright shining days consisting of golden or silver light. This light is typically radiated from the mountains or clouds themselves and ebb and flow in brightness throughout the day. Though the bottom-most layer, Lunia, is in perpetual night time, its stars and moon radiate enough silver light for most to be able to see perfectly fine. When it rains, it is no harder than a sunshower, though on the fourth layer of Solania, sometimes the dwarven god causes great and horrible storms.

# Traits

## Travel to the Plane

Visitors to this plane can arrive in a variety of ways. Drifting through the Astral Sea, you can move through a gold color pool, you could travel from Arcadia or Bytopia through a portal, or use a spell to bring you here. Regardless of how you travel to this plane, you arrive in the same location, the shallow surf of the ocean that surrounds the lowest level of this plane. This ocean is freshwater and is home to a variety of species of fish, sea elves, coral reefs, giant oysters, dolphins, and more. While it isn’t unheard of for the unaware to drown in this ocean, the inhabitants of the ocean will help any who fall into the ocean and begin drowning, unless they are given good reason to not help.

## Traversing the Plane

![Manual of the Planes, 1987 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530643331-EVMLUD1XCOZHFJ867E1Q/TraversingPlane_MoP1e.png?format=500w)

**Manual of the Planes**, 1987 TSR Inc.

Traversing this plane is just as easy as climbing a mountain, though there are footpaths everywhere as well as gleaming white citadels, cities, and fortifications. Pilgrims from all over can be found walking up and down these paths, searching for the portals that will take them from one layer to the next, and while many of these portals exist physically, they can only be used when you are spiritually ready.

Climbing from one layer to the next isn’t nearly as easy as climbing from the bottom of one layer to the top of it. You must go on a personal pilgrimage to purify yourself, for only those who can pass the tribulations and spiritual tests can ever fully ascend to the next layer. Many find this a difficult proposition, especially after ascending to the fourth and fifth levels where only the purest can ever ascend to the next level. And it isn’t just the pilgrims who have traveled here who must undergo these spiritual tests, but also the petitioners, the archons, who travel across this plane searching to ascend not only to the next level but also to the next form of archon and to become one with this plane.

The physical conditions of this plane vary greatly depending on what layer you are currently traversing across. Pilgrims must be aware of rock slides, deal with muddy footpaths where the mud is several feet deep and worse. Deep valleys cut across the mountains, and finding a path up a sheer cliff can be incredibly dangerous and difficult. If you are under the protection of the archons, they can help guide you safely up many of these dangerous areas.

## The Paths

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530706866-8JKA2VK70FN5T9C8AFD9/image-asset.jpeg?format=500w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

There are a wide variety of paths that an archon and a pilgrim can take when venturing up the Mount Celestia, and it isn’t just physical. If a pilgrim so chooses, they can follow a spiritual path where they give themselves over to a set ideology and must continue to follow that ideology as they move up the layers, while they are following this path they gain boons that are focused towards their path and lantern archons watch over them as they climb the mountain. If they break from their path, it means that they are no longer being watched over and they lose their boons, and while they can still travel across the plane, they must fend for themselves and it is much more dangerous.

Archons are different, archons must follow a path and they can not leave that path or become an outcast, a fallen archon. While lantern archons have more leeway than other archons, as they are typically treated like children who do something wrong, it is expected that archons are always pushing themselves to become pure.

One of the paths that an archon or pilgrim might take is the Eightfold Path which emphasizes patience, pacifism, courage, joy, discipline, generosity, kindness, and teaching others. As a way to help them follow this path, they are given a boon to their Charisma, allowing them to be more helpful and pleasant to those they meet.

# Locations

Up and down Mount Celestia are the gleaming citadels, the cities of petitioners and pilgrims, and fortifications of warriors and knights waiting for the day that the plane needs their protection. Standing at the bottom of the mountain and looking up, you can see the gleaming mountain before you, perfectly clear. At the very top of the mountain is the gleaming final layer that few are ever able to ascend too.

## Lunia, the Silver Heaven

Lunia is the only plane to touch the Astral Plane and is the bottom of Mount Celestia, or the first mountain depending on how you view the Seven Heavens. This layer is in perpetual night, though its glistening silver stars and moon give off enough light to see. This night is not a haunting and frightening night, but rather a peaceful summer night that is warming and inviting.

Upon arriving on this layer, you are in the freshwater ocean that circles Mount Celestia and, depending on where you arrive, might find yourself wading through the shallows or swimming over an infinitely deep pit in the ocean. There are beings, like the sea elves, dolphins, and other creatures who will quickly rush to the aid of those who begin drowning… though if they are given reason too, they are willing to let the unworthy drown.

Wading, or swimming, to the sandy beaches, you can see glistening citadels and cities, with many reports of different styles of architecture, leading many to believe there might be different mountains or islands on this bottom layer. The water on this plane is freshwater and tastes sweet, though it is divinely blessed as it operates like Holy Water, destroying undead and fiends who swim through this ocean. When the waves break onto the beaches, it sounds like chimes in the wind.

There are portals to other planes that exist in the shallows of this plane, solid blocks of black granite shot with gold lead to Arcadia, white granite block shot with silver leads to Bytopia, red blocks spattered with blue flecks leads to the Outlands. These portals are free-standing and permanent, they never move, they never change, and are always reliable.

![Manual of the Planes, 2001 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530743714-YWXE9YEYZXUQEEQZ63ZD/Celestia_MoP3e.png?format=750w)

**Manual of the Planes**, 2001 WotC

### Heart’s Faith

The largest city on this layer is known as Heart’s Faith and is situated very close to a portal to the Outlands. You can find all sorts of goods, temples to minor gods, and people living their lives. The town is happy, children are well-behaved and no one feels the need to lock their doors. Protecting this city are the Lammasu, celestials that look to be a hybrid of a human, bird, and have the face of a lion. These guardians watch over the city and Lebes, a greater Lammasu, rules over the city and hears the case for every wrongdoing in it.

## Mercuria, the Golden Heaven

The second layer of Mount Celestia is Mercuria, and here is where the air first grows thin, causing many new arrivals to be light-headed and giddy. This layer is washed in the golden light that radiates from the clouds, which helps make many feel bubbly and excited for their continued spiritual growth. The mountains in Mercuria are young, thrusting high into the sky with deep valleys and rushing rivers and beautiful, verdant grasslands.

The noblest of fighters and warriors are interred here, their great tombs and mausoleums a proclamation of their valor, their deeds inscribed in stone for all to see. They reside in their places of rest for eternity as markers to other pilgrims to showcase valor and honor, of achieving goodness and lawfulness.

### The Dragon’s Palace

Some call the dragon god Bahamut, others refer to him as the Draco Paladin, regardless, his palace can always be found on this layer where he is protected by his seven great wyrms. This palace is a wonder to be held and is built using the dragon god’s hoard of treasure, windows of gemstones in gold and silver, walls of inlaid copper and ivory, and floors of beaten mithral. The petitioners of the dragon god, as well as his servants and wyrm protectors, can be found in this palace serving his will.

The palace can always be found on this second layer, though it sometimes also exists on the first layer, as well as the third and fourth layer when the dragon god wishes it too. There are also portals to the Plane of Air and the Astral Plane hidden throughout his palace, and they are protected by Archons who make sure no one uses these portals that shouldn’t be.

## Venya, the Pearly Heaven

The third layer, Venya, is made up of old mountains that are rounded at the top with gentle slopes and trickling brooks. These waters are warm and fresh, causing life to flourish in this layer. The light is a white, pearlescent color exuded from the very air itself and many of those who reside here are halflings whose god resides on this layer. During the winter, the shore of rivers and brooks become coated in ice, making the upper reaches of this plane almost impassable.

### Green Fields

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530804007-HTCTE72ISK7TMYIHFFBO/image-asset.png?format=300w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

The softly rolling hills of Green Fields is the home of multiple halfling villages, all overgrown with beautiful and lush farms growing a variety of vegetables and plants all year round. The most fearsome beast that the halflings must contend with are the badgers and rabbits who nibble at their crops, though there are never enough of them to be a problem and the halflings do little to stop them.

Each of these halfling villages looks very similar to each other, but halflings of one village take great pride in being from that village. The easiest way to tell these villages apart is that each has a single, ancient tree in the town square, and that tree is of a different species for each village. No two villages have the same species, and halflings take great pride in their villages' tree and decorate their homes with elements of it.

## Solania, the Electrum Heaven/Crystal Heaven

Solania, the fourth layer, glows with the soft aura of burnished silver and silvery mists curl about the mountainsides. This layer is seen as the home for all dwarfs, for their dwarven god, who many call Moradin, resides here deep in this mountain. There, he works at his forge making weapons, dwarves, and other magical items.

The mountain peaks on this layer are capped with ice, and the roads along this mountain have two conditions: impassable and knee-deep mud. These roads are mostly impassable except for a few weeks during the summer when the ice melts from the mountain and the pilgrims rush forward to the summit to continue their journeys of ascension.

### Erackinor

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579530981719-RNIKRTNUUF1X5YZX2ZP4/image-asset.png?format=300w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

Erackinor is the home of the dwarfs and consists of tunnels dotting across this layer. Inside, which only dwarves are ever allowed to enter, is said to be the greatest work dwarves have ever created, far eclipsing the stonework found on the Material Plane. Not only are the greatest dwarven artisans found in these hallow tunnels, but also the mightest dwarven warriors who defend this home with a religious fervor. This is the home of their dwarven god, and the Soul Forge, which is used to craft dwarven weapons and even the dwarves themselves.

## Mertion, the Platinum Heaven

![The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea, 2010 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579531009796-NPVKY9LOLRKXN256RSCV/image-asset.png?format=300w)

**The Plane Above: Secrets of the Astral Sea,** 2010 WotC

The fifth layer, Mertion, is made up of sweeping plains, beautiful mountain lakes, and massive black domes. Its sky, much like Solania’s, is a bright silver though this sky is so pure and the light so piercing that any undead who might make their way to this plane are blasted by its radiant light, causing them to burn to ash.

Dotting across the plains of this layer are citadels and spherical black domes made of some sort of smooth material. The black domes are the size of small mountains and most are perfectly smooth, making it incredibly hard to climb them unless you have wings. Some of these domes have stairs carved into them, and many pilgrims climb these domes so that they might pass on to the next layer, though they must find the right dome. It is said that these domes are the stepping stones that the gods used to ascend to godhood, though no one knows for sure the purpose of these domes.

### Empyrea, the City of Tempered Souls

One of the cities on this layer is Empyrea and it is full of fountains of all types and sizes. These fountains are renown across the planes for their healing properties, they can heal any ailment or affliction, you must simply find the right fountain. Many pilgrims who undergo this journey are looking for Empyrea and their fountain, hoping to cure their ailments in its fountains.

### Soqed Hezi, the City of Swords

This citadel is the home to the archons and is one of preparedness and defenses. It has high walls, defensive tunnels and is home to thousands of sword archons waiting for the day they are called to defend their plane. This city follows military disciplines and is ruled by a sword archon known as Bahram who rules from a throne of swords. All who reside in this city follow their orders without question and are always training.

## Jovar, the Glittering Heaven

This sixth heaven of Mount Celestia, known as Jovar, is a land of beautiful gems the size of hills and houses strewn about the slopes. These gems provide a glittering light and their beauty causes many to lose themselves upon seeing it. Very few pilgrims ever make it to this layer, and very few, if any, ever make it from this layer to the final layer.

Little is known about this layer, except there are far more archons on this layer than any other layer of Mount Celestia.

### Yetsirah, the Heavenly City

This city is only for archons and only archons reside here. They are ruled by a council of thone archons who weigh and value each and every archon, deciding whether to elevate them or not. This city lies inside of a seven-layered ziggurat of immense size. It is said that the only way to get to the seventh layer is to find it’s hidden entrance inside of the central ziggurat.

### Bridge of al-Sihal

This bridge is guarded by the solar known as Xerona who judges every pilgrim and archon who makes it this far. Many are turned away, judged not pure enough to enter the seventh layer of Mount Celestia. No one knows what is beyond the bridge as no one has ever returned.

## Chronias, the Illuminated Heaven

Some say that this layer leads directly to the Plane of Positive Energy, burning away mortal flesh and evil intentions until only what is pure remains. Others claim that this layer doesn’t actually exist and instead when a pilgrim crosses into this plane they become one with the plane, not even the gods know what resides here or, at least, they aren’t telling anyone if they do. Regardless, no one has ever returned from visiting this layer and so it remains one of the greatest mysteries of the planes.

# Factions & People

## Archons

The archons make up the largest group on this plane, and they are the souls of the petitioners. The archons are often compared to the demons of the Abyss, they exist because of this plane and the plane exists because of them. The archons are all lawful good and constantly seek to better themselves so that they may become part of this plane in a type of ascension. The archons are broken into different forms, though they typically follow a very set hierarchy.

### Lantern Archons

These are the most plentiful of all the archons and are the first form that most petitioners become, though some souls are worthy of starting higher up the hierarchy if they were beyond exceptional in life. The lantern archons resemble a globe of light and lack any ability to interact with the physical world beyond lashing out with radiant rays of light.

These archons are often treated like children by the higher up archons, forgiven often for failing their paths and reproached with a gentle hand. The lantern archons are still just the souls of petitioners and have yet to reach purity.

### Proxy Archons

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579531097469-NQ3EADT4MAIY81LDNHIO/image-asset.png?format=500w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

The next step for lantern archons is to become proxies, those who are trusted by the gods and are given additional power. The hierarchy for a proxy archon is hound, warden, sword, and tome. Each of these archons have specific jobs, though these aren't the only forms that an archon can take and some are called to a more specialized role, like the throne archons.

**Hound archons** are the guardians of the paths that go up and down the first and second layer, they appear human though they have a dog head. 

**Warden archons** are the protectors of portals and gateways that lead from one layer to the next.

**Sword archons** are the warriors and the fighters who destroy any fiends who attempt to attack Mount Celestia. They are also the holy messengers of the tome archons.

**Throne archons** are the rulers of cities across Mount Celestia and can command any other archon except for the tome archons.

**Tome archons** are the highest of the archons and there are only seven of them, each controlling a specific layer of Mount Celestia. 

**Trumpet archons** are one of the few archons who reside outside of Mount Celestia, thus risking eternal oblivion if they die outside the plane. They travel to the Prime Material where their trumpet bursts can return the dead to life and go on special missions that the tome archons send them on.

## Pilgrims

Beyond the archons, and the regular inhabitants of Mount Celestia, are the pilgrims seeking enlightenment and ascension to the highest layer of this plane. They are on a spiritual journey for goodness and lawfulness, though many don’t make it past the second layer. This journey can take years and years, causing many to be disheartened and to end their pilgrimage to the top.

## Warriors and Paladins

Across the plane, though mostly found on the fifth layer Mertion, are the paladins of holy order. They are constantly training for the day that they are needed to protect the plane and its inhabitants from an outside threat. They are warriors of goodness and law, following their orders without question. They practice the values of valor, mercy, and order.

### Order of the Planes-Militant

![Planes of Law, 1995 TSR Inc.](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1579531118279-8AWAATB41GF5WNMGERBQ/image-asset.png?format=500w)

**Planes of Law**, 1995 TSR Inc.

This faction exists only on Mount Celestia as many on this plane have little interest in the factions of Sigil. This faction’s sole purpose is to defend the fortress of Mount Celestia against avarice, chaos, evil, and doubt. These warriors are constantly focused on the protection of Mount Celestia and have even been able to bring land from Arcadia and the Outlands by changing that lands and people's alignment to match this plane. They are zealous in their philosophy and protection of Mount Celestia.

# Encounters

**Abyssal Pearl -** On the first layer, Lunia, a massive oyster was found with a huge pearl inside that looked to be pure black. The lantern archons began studying it, though one of them has gone missing along with the pearl. Many fear that the pearl was formed from a demon that tried to pass into this plane and was destroyed in its pure waters, it’s soul stuck inside that pearl. The rumors are that that demon’s soul has now possessed the lantern archon and many are worried about what that might mean.

**Bahamut’s Palace -** Rumors in Sigil are that you can take a shortcut to get to the second, third or fourth layer easily by sneaking into the dragon god’s palace and finding the right portal. Of course, you have to sneak past the seven great wyrms that guard the palace and who see everything.

**Fallen Archon -** A lantern archon has fallen to corruption and evil, or at least that’s what the other archons are saying. In fact, it’s just gotten too involved in the workings of the Prime Material plane and is trying to guide the people to enlightenment and goodness. A sword archon has been dispatched to destroy it.

**Solar’s Task -** A solar has descended from the seventh layer, and everyone wants to know what’s up there. The solar isn’t talking, except to you. They need your help to destroy a fiendish presence growing in Sigil. They’d do it, but they can’t move across Sigil without attracting a lot of attention and the fiend keeps escaping them.

**Tomb of a Knight -** On the second layer of Mount Celestia is the tomb to an ancient knight of valor and order. It’s also where their weapon is, buried with them for all eternity. Unfortunately, that weapon is a powerful artifact and you need it to stop the Prime Material plane from being destroyed… the archons aren’t giving it up though, for they need it to defend Mount Celestia in case a demonic invasion happens.

**Game of Mountains -** In 4th edition, all seven mountains exist in the same place, three of them controlled by their respective gods and four of them constantly fought over for. You have been selected by one of the gods to participate in the Game of Mountains, all you have to do is get to the top of a mountain and hold it against the forces of the other gods. Don't worry, they'll resurrect you a day later if you should fall, it's all in good fun.
