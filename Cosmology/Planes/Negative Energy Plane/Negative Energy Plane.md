# Negative Energy Plane
*Plane information for Negative Energy Plane*

**Alternate Name:** -
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Energons

**Description:** Travelers are first greeted with a night so black that many might swear they had been struck blind, but even that darkness can’t compare to the Negative Energy Plane. It is often described as a darkness so pure that it is like standing on a barren world in the pitch blackness of night with no stars or moons shining, while you have your eyes closed, a thousand miles beneath the ground, and in a _darkness_ spell. This void isn’t empty though, for there is a greedy nature of the plane that sucks out all life of anything and everything. Heat and life are drawn out, matter decays, and energy is removed. 

This plane is known for its non-stop hunger for everything. It is a dark and empty plane, uncaring and intolerant of all life. It truly is the most hostile of all the planes, though that doesn’t mean everything within it is destroyed. Undeath and those who seek it claim home within its darkness.

This plane is relatively empty and devoid of anything that might resemble life or being. While the plane is considered to be part of the Inner Planes, it is not a true elemental plane, meaning that it doesn’t even create elementals aligned with itself. Outsiders that survive this plane are few and only found in specific locations, clinging to life, or unlife as it happens to be. Unlike the Positive Energy Plane, this plane does have a thriving population of undead. 

While many might believe that all undeath comes from the Shadowfell, even the Shadowfell gains much of its power over undeath from the Negative Energy Plane. Not every type of undead can be found on this plane though as even they find it difficult to live out their death here. Those undead who suck the essence from other creatures finds a welcoming respite on this plane, wraiths, specters, wights, vampires, and liches make their home on the sucking and ever-hungry plane of negative energy. 

The only creature that can be thought to be a true native of this plane is the xeg-yi, a sentient form of energy of an alien mind and body. No one is sure where, or what they truly are, but they go about this plane as if on some task known only to them.

Devoid of life and energy, this plane drains 2d6 hit points per minute spent on the plane. If this reduces a creature to 0 hit points, they immediately die, their soul consumed by the plane - which is impossible to ever restore even with the most powerful magic or by the intervention of a god - and their body is animated into a form of undeath. To survive this process, a creature must gain access to a _negative energy protection_ spell before arriving on this plane or the spell has no effect as its energy is immediately drained from it by the plane.

Pure black is all that can be seen on this plane with any light immediately extinguished by the plane, no matter how powerful the spell. Any damage spell that is cast on this plane does its maximum amount of damage, while any healing spell is reduced to the least amount that it can heal. This plane hates any form of life or energy, be it a living creature or object. Any objects on a creature stay formed while the creature lives, but as soon as it is let go or the creature dies, the objects fall apart and disintegrate as if subjected to aging from eons of years unattended. Even powerful magical artifacts will eventually succumb to this plane’s death.
