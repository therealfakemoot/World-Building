# Elemental Plane of Fire
*Plane information for Elemental Plane of Fire*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:**  All
**Inhabitants:** Fire Elementals

**Description:** The Plane of Elemental Fire was a hellish place, filled with all manner and color of flame from the candle to the white-hot glow of heated steel, all burning without fuel and radiating light and heat at maximum levels. Most unprotected matter was quickly consumed by the flames but pockets of other elements could survive in "cold spots" where the temperature was near that of a hot Prime desert. The evil efreet and their fabled City of Brass resided here. Also the dwarf-like azer mined the basalt rocks that survived the heat for metals for their craft. Kossuth, the tyrant-king of the fire elementals dwelt in his palace at the center of his realm called The Crimson Pillar.

The Plane of Fire is one of the major planes that make up the Inner Planes, it is the home of fire elementals, efreets, the source of fire, and one of the largest cities in the multiverse, the City of Brass. This plane is often thought to be the least hospitable of any of the Inner Planes, the idea of an entire plane composed of fire leads many to assume that it is certain death to travel there, though that isn’t completely true. Much like many of the Lower Planes, like Gehenna or the Abyss, it can be dangerous to arrive on this plane but so long as you take the proper precautions, it is trivial to travel the plane.

## History

The Plane of Fire was first developed in the 1st edition’s _Manual of the Planes (1987)_ and was the first Inner Plane to have a clear distinction between up and down. Whereas the other major Inner Planes were just a singular element all-around a creature, this plane was known as a sea of fire with a bottom ‘layer’ made up of super-compact fire that created a physical surface for you to walk upon. In 4th edition, this plane was combined into the Elemental Chaos, and while much of it was discarded, the City of Brass became the major city of the chaos. 5th edition returned the elements back to their own planes on the Inner Planes.

Interestingly, 5th edition does introduce a few new things to this plane, which is something similar it has done for all other Inner Planes. Not only does the Plane of Fire get a blazing sun high above it, but the deadliness of the plane is greatly reduced until it is more like a hot desert than the hottest fires of the multiverse like in the past editions.

## An Outsider’s Perspective

Arriving in the Plane of Fire is a dangerous proposition for the ill-prepared or those who have no idea where they are going. Blistering heat and thin atmosphere await travelers, and unless you have protection against fire, the intense heat will quickly ignite anyone who arrives here. Tales continue to come out of this plane of unprepared adventurers being immediately reduced to ash. 

Despite the hostility of this plane, it is also the most populated of the Inner Planes, a fact any traveler who can survive the first few minutes of this plane should be aware of. Creatures of all types can be found wandering through this plane, all born or made of fire in some form or another. Most of these creatures, specifically the eleminals, animals that take on an elemental form, respond like normal creatures found on the Material Plane, though the biggest threat is the efreet who go on hunting parties for fun, tracking down outsiders, and enslaving them.

It’s not just fire that can be found on this plane, as motes of other elements sometimes make their way on to this plane. Unfortunately for travelers and those elements, they typically only last for a short time before they are merged into the intense heat and fire of this plane, the air is ignited, water evaporates, and the metals and minerals of earth melts into magma. There are also cities, outposts, and towers that make up this plane, the inhabitants enforcing their will through magical wards that protect their land from the flames. The City of Brass is the most well known of these cities, but there are also efreet outposts all over the plane who lead raids on the marid and the Plane of Water, as well as the towers of the azer where they form their clans and work on their crafts.

## A Native’s Perspective

The natives of this plane are largely the fire elementals, sentient creatures formed from the plane, who form the ‘wildlife’ of this plane. From birds composed of fiery wings, to even the fire rats that scurry through the fields of wheat and fruit on the Obsidian Fields found outside of the City of Brass, these creatures are the strange and otherworldy cousins of the natural beasts found on the Material Plane. 

Apart from those elementals, often referred to as eleminals, are the efreet, azer, and the firenewts and salamanders. These societies typically leave each other alone, instead, they focus on their borders, though they will trade with each other so long as they aren’t currently fighting over disputed territories. The most powerful of these are the efreet who see themselves as the natural leaders of the plane, and the rest of the multiverse. Their hatred of the marid is well known, but they also wage a war against the Plane of Air and its djinni. The only genie kind they don’t try to subjugate are the dao of the Plane of Earth, but even that relationship is one built on the destruction of the other genie kinds. 

The efreet are the more welcoming of the inhabitants here, though even that is fairly suspect if you are found traveling through the Plane of Fire. Outsiders are treated with some respect throughout the different communities, with hospitality being somewhat equated to what types of goods a traveler has to trade or sell. If an outsider stumbles upon a mote of an element, especially one of earth, it is often already found by the inhabitants of this plane who are quickly trying to save it from the destruction of their plane. Azer will often claim large blocks of rock as theirs and attempt to ward it from the angry fires, forming new villages for their clan. 

## Atmosphere

Filled with the roaring flames of fire, this plane is seen as the most hostile plane in the multiverse, though that isn’t completely true as the Negative and Positive Energy Planes are far more dangerous. A creature who first arrives here will notice the intense heat suddenly burning their body and the hot orange and white glow of fire filling their vision. If they have a way of surviving the intense heat, they will also need to figure out how to survive the incredibly thin atmosphere filled with dangerous fumes that will shred and ignite their lungs. 

Luckily for many, the efreet are interested in ensuring that traders and their slaves don’t immediately burn up into soot, so if a traveler arrives in the City of Brass or one of the many other cities or outposts on the Plane of Fire, the efreet, and other locals, have gone to great lengths to use their magic to protect all inhabitants. Being prepared for arrival on this plane goes a long way in ensuring your survival, of course, if you are relying on magic, you must ensure that you are powerful enough to continue your wards and protections for hour after hour with no downtime for a break to recharge your batteries.

There is no night or day on this plane, though most track time in 24 hours based off of the Material Plane. In 5th edition, that is changed so that there is a blistering sun high overhead that burns down with brilliant light during the day and darkens to a harsh, dull red glow during the night. 

Traveling to the borders of this plane, the temperature drops, though only slightly, and instead new elements begin infusing the fire. The closer you move towards the Plane of Earth, and traveling across the great Cinder Wastes, the ground becomes a bit more solid as you enter the Plane of Magma, also called the Fountains of Creation as volcanoes belch their molten rocks. In the opposite direction is the Plane of Air, as you travel in that direction the air gets harder to see through and there are more flammable materials from the neighboring plane. As the air gets thicker, the thick smoke chokes your lungs and ash fills your mouth as you move through the Sea of Fire and enter the Great Conflagration or the Plane of Ash. 

# Traits

## Travel to the Plane

Traveling to this Inner Plane can take on a wide variety of forms that can range from accidental travels, which typically end poorly, to purposeful trips to the azer craftsmen in their basalt towers. Traveling from the Ethereal Plane requires finding an orange color curtain and stepping into it, though even that can be dangerous as the Border Ethereal of the Plane of Fire is also incredibly hot and capable of setting creatures on fire, just not as fast as if they were on the plane. 

A traveler could also attempt to journey from the Material Plane by finding massive amounts of fire in a singular location, much like how the other Inner Planes are linked to the Material Plane. This can create a vortex or permanent portal that allows easy travel from one plane to the next, though due to the nature of fire, most civilized lands do as much as they can to prevent sufficient quantities of fire in a single place. Most are forced to travel into a volcano and searching for a portal there, in which case those travelers are probably already equipped for their journey to the Plane of Fire. 

Another mundane way of traveling is finding, or setting, forest fires that create massive blazes and stretches for miles and miles. At the center of this conflagration, one might be able to form a temporary portal to the Plane of Fire, allowing access that one time. One can also find a few portals in Sigil that are permanently linked to the Plane of Fire, these portals can be found in use in the Lower Ward. The Foundry in Sigil uses the heat of the plane to help them craft their weapons, while the Mortuary also has a portal to this plane, using the fire to help them cremate their dead. 

Travelers can also arrive in this plane by traveling from its counterpart planes, by traveling to the edges of the Plane of Air, you can walk through the Plane of Ash and arrive in the Plane of Fire. Likewise, traveling from the Plane of Earth through the Plane of Magma, you can then arrive in the Plane of Fire. This is difficult as these planes are all considered infinite, and rely on focusing your mind where you wish to travel, but even then there is no guarantee you’ll ever find the border crossings. To have the greatest chance of crossing, you need an elemental guide who knows the plane you are trying to cross, like a mephit or elemental, and somehow convince them to help.

## Traversing the Plane

Travel can be dangerous for those who aren’t prepared, though they often don’t get long enough on this plane to even start traveling. Creatures who can survive here, whether through natural ability or magic, find it an easy plane to traverse. Due to having a definite gravity, due to fire always rising up, it’s easy to keep your bearings, though there is a distinct lack of landmarks. To travel to any location in the Plane of Fire either requires a lot of luck or finding an elemental guide who knows their way around the Plane of Fire and can ‘feel’ their way to your destination. 

Once you do figure out your direction, all it takes is putting one step in front of the other. While much of this plane is part of the Sea of Fire, it’s not difficult to navigate it. The fire becomes so dense the further and further down you go in this plane that it gets compacted and turns into a physical form that can carry your weight. While walking through the sea of fire your vision is severely limited, only about 20 feet, the sea of fire is only ever 15 feet deep and thus is quite easy to move through.

Some enterprising individuals have figured out ways of protecting boats from the intense heat of this plane and can sail their craft through these flaming waters. These boatmen are happy to take on passengers, though they are largely used to transporting materials across the plane to the different outposts and towns, selling their wares far and wide along the sea of fire. 

## Shadow Fire

While the Plane of Fire is composed of fire and flames, there are dark spots on this plane that all elementals of this plane avoid. These dark spots are the shadow fire, a reverse of this plane that is composed of freezing flames. Stepping into this shadow, fire elementals and anyone that has immunity to fire immediately begin freezing, the cold seeping into their bodies and freezing them solid. This even affects those who use magic to prepare themselves for the fire, the very magics used to protect them from the fire seem to amplify the cold and chill them to the bone, their frozen forms left behind like ice statues. Strangely, those who have no protection from the fire are unaffected by the shadow fire and instead find it quite a nice place to react. The harsh flames no longer lick at them angrily, and instead, they can survive, somewhat, in the shadow fire. Though, if they had no protection from the fires of this plane, most will never get a chance to find shadow fire and save themselves from being immolated by the plane.

# Locations

## City of Brass

![Manual of the Planes, 2008 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1594646580966-U4XXQ32EWHO36WDTRXCM/Map_CityofBrass_4e.jpg?format=500w)

**Manual of the Planes**, 2008 WotC

The most well known of the Inner Planes cities, the City of Brass is the capital of the efreet kingdom and the capital of the Plane of Fire. This massive city, spanning over 10 miles wide and almost 20 miles long, sits on the edge of the Sea of Fire. In the early editions, it sat on top of a massive 40-mile wide hemisphere made of pure brass that hovers over a basalt slab. In 4th and 5th edition, it sits on the Cinder Wastes, a great plateau of fire and stone that acts as the ‘dry’ land next to the Sea of Fire. 

The great efreet sultan oversees his kingdom from here, and the efreet watch over this city and ensures that the horrible ash and flame storms don’t pierce through its protections. This city, and the brass hemisphere it sits on, is protected from the Plane of Fire, making it a liveable city for all without the need of protection. Outside of this protection, the heat of the Plane of Fire rages in full force, which often dissuades slaves from running away from their cruel masters. 

The markets of this city hold all manner of goods, from the exotic magic items of legendary power to the mundane grain that the efreet slaves grow off in the Obsidian Fields outside of the city. Anything worth anything can be found in these markets.

Due to the size of this city, no one is entirely sure how many people reside here as the efreet hasn’t done a census in over a decade. Most guesses place the population around 4 million with slaves making up about a fifth of that population. 

## The Crimson Pillar

Hanging high above the surface of the plane is a blue-white orb that is so hot and intense that even creatures who are immune to heat can’t move closer than 100 miles to it without beginning to burn themselves up. Elementals, efreet, and others all avoid this pillar unless its occupant, Kossuth, the Tyrant-King of Fire Elementals, calls on them and provides them the proper protection when visiting this realm. 

## The Crucible

A great azer tower sits on an island surrounded by a bubbling and boiling lake of platinum. On the island is a forest of metallic-trees, instead of wood and bark, they are made out of pure metals like silver and gold. Here, the azer toil away on their forges, harvesting the trees for the metals to be worked into shape. The most well-known artisan is the great Shanmakeen whose skill is known far and wide, those who are seeking a powerful magical weapon often seek him and for his help. 

# Factions & People

## Azer

![Monster Manual, 2014 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1594646428105-XDJHDZWX4JV0OEC2YTKE/image-asset.png?format=300w)

**Monster Manual**, 2014 WotC

Found largely on the motes of earth that appear here from the Plane of Earth, the azer are craftsmen who specialize in gems and rare metals, their secrets of magic, and forging assist them in creating works of art and items of great power. Rumors persist that it was the azer who helped build the City of Brass, though if you ask an efreet, it might be the last thing you ever ask. 

The azer and efreet largely leave each other alone, though they sometimes skirmish when they meet each other outside of the City of Brass or the other cities in this plane. Some claim that the azer was almost enslaved by the efreet and that the azer didn’t take kindly to it.

## Efreet

![Monster Manual, 2014 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1594646485930-OU0FJDKNNOPTQ2AS3EMM/Efreet_MM_5e.jpeg?format=500w)

**Monster Manual**, 2014 WotC

This race of genie has claimed control over the Plane of Fire, believing themselves to be the master of the plane and the City of Brass being their capital. To show off their strength, they have hundreds of outposts and small cities set up around the Plane of Fire ruled over by the nobility of the efreet who oversee their territories and make sure that laws are being followed, to go on raids against the Plane of Air and the Plane of Water, as well as find more slaves to be sent back to the City of Brass. 

Recently, there has been a major power struggle between the leading efreet royal families with the old sultan being killed and his family enslaved, and the new efreet sultan taking on power. Many are worried about what this might mean for the City of Brass as there is little known about this new sultan and if he wishes to enforce his will through violence and armies of the efreet.

## Elementals

The source of creation for fire elementals, mephits, and others, these creatures appear to be on fire and their forms flicker in and out like crackling fire. Fire elementals are as cruel as fire, though they can be bargained with if you can provide them entertainment or something to burn and destroy.

## The Powers

![Princes of the Apocalypse, 2015 WotC](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5bd88db093a6320f071b1a50/1594646534579-UMJTQ8LQJTP5YWHNHV7S/image-asset.png?format=500w)

**Princes of the Apocalypse**, 2015 WotC

There are three major powers on this plane, not including the near-god-like power of the sultan of the efreet. Imix might be the most well known, he appears as a column of pure fire and is the elemental Prince of the Evil Elementals, he is directly opposed by Zaaman Rul who many see as the bastard of Imix. Zaaman Rul is one of the princes of elemental good and recently suffered a horrible loss against Imix when Zaaman Rul attempted to overthrow his hold over the Plane of Fire.

The most powerful of these gods is Kossuth, the Tyrant-King of the Fire Elementals, who holds sway over every inhabitant of the Plane of Fire. While the efreet doesn’t worship him, instead, forcing their slaves to worship them, they at least respect his power and try to avoid any interaction with Kossuth and any of the other powers. It is said that Kossuth is so powerful that he could remove Imix and Zaaman Rul with little effort, and many are surprised he hasn’t done so yet. It is no secret that Imix is planning on destroying Kossuth just as soon as he removes Zaaman Rul. 

# Encounters

**Charcoal Palace -** The seat of power in the City of Brass is the Charcoal Palace where the sultan of efreet resides. Rumors of great magic, wealth, and power are always coming out of this palace but that hasn’t stopped thieves from attempting to get a bit of that treasure. Lately, an azer has come forward claiming his ancient family built the palace and he has blueprints for sneaking in and stealing the hoard of treasure from under the sultan’s nose, he just needs a few strong-types willing to protect him from the various traps found in the palace.

**Efreet Incident -** Traveling across the Plane of Fire, you have been ‘mistaken’ for escaped slaves from the City of Brass. The noble efreet of this area has decided to make a game of it, sending his firedogs and firehawks after you before running you down on his nightmare steed.

**Firefruit -** One of the most dangerous fruits to mere mortals from the Material Plane, the firefruit appears to be a sweet orange. Upon eating it, most creatures not of the Plane of Fire can feel the burning sensation and no amount of magic helps. Most outsiders might be tricked into eating one, and the fire of this fruit burns them from the inside-out.

**Streets of Brass -** Walking through the twisted maze that are the streets of the City of Brass, you have gotten lost and wound up in the Rookery, the most dangerous and lawless section of the city that the guards refuse to patrol. Up ahead is a barricade in the street, and behind you is a mix of genasi and azer asking about your day and sizing you up, their eyes lingering on money purses.

**The Great Hunt -** The Sultan has decided to go on a great hunt through the Plane of Fire, wishing to hunt all the exotic eleminals that make up this plane. Going along with him s all of his retinues and has extended an invitation to adventurers and powerful warriors to join him in a deadly hunt against the famed Pheonix.
