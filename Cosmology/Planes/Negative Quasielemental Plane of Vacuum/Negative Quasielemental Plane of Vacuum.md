# Negative Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum
*Plane information for Negative Quasielemental Plane of Vacuum*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** This empty expanse between the Plane of Air and the nothing of the Negative Every Plane is known as the Vacuum. As one moves further from the Plane of Air, the atmosphere thins until it is completely gone as you get to the Negative Energy Plane. While there is no atmosphere or anything, in this vacuum the pressure and temperature remain consistent, unchanging. Freezing or burning is not the threat of this plane, but rather the lack of anything. Spells that would transform elements into a breathable atmosphere do not function, like _water breathing_, and even wings on a bird have no use for this is nothing to flap against.

Thought of as the prelude to death, this plane is of nothing. No light. No sound. No breath. All around is a vacuum, no materials exist at the closest borders to the Negative Energy Plane. Even the quasielementals of vacuum are beings of no body. Invisible force, that can never be seen, moves through the plane, striking any living creature it finds. These elementals are a vacuum in and of themselves, and if they happen to find themselves on another plane, they flee as quickly as they can as they fear the thick atmosphere. Those who are unable to escape fall into a hibernetic shock state, forming themselves into spheres of invisible force until they can return to their plane.Â 

Beyond the elemental animals of this plane, the plane is also home to a large number of undead creatures like ghosts and other spectral creatures. While there are a few ghouls, most undead of this plane are simply the spirits of those who died long ago and hunt through this plane. The quasi-elementals hate these creatures, for they are still something unlike the pure vacuum that the elementals represent.
