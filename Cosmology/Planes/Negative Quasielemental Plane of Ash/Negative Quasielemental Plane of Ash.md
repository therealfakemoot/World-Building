# Negative Quasielemental Plane of Ash
*Plane information for Negative Quasielemental Plane of Ash*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** Transitioning from the Plane of Fire to the Negative Energy Plane, Ash is thought to be the cooling of the fire, as no warmth can be found here. Instead, only the remains of material long ago burned and destroyed by fire remains. The entire plane is covered in ash that hangs in the area, restricting vision and creating a poisonous atmosphere for those who inhale in the ash. The ground is thick, made up of millions of thick fluffy flakes of ash that are compressed to create a springy ground that is easy to dig through.

Cold. Grey. Miles upon unlimited miles of ash that chokes all who enter this realm. The inhabitants of this realm are just as cold as the plane they reside on, having little care for others to the point of wanting to convert them into ash themselves. The inhabitants of this plane are largely the quasielementals, beings of ash themselves. They see anyone visiting their plane as intruders, only fit to be killed and turned into the ash. The ash quasielementals have a single large empire focused around a fortification known as the Citadel of Former Flame where they plan their attacks on the Plane of Fire. They hope to one day destroy the plane since once the fire dies out, all that remains is ash.

Rumors swirl that there is a substance on this plane known as mage powder and that it can drain the spells out of a spellcaster. This ash is highly prized and one of the few reasons outsiders intrude on the inhabitants, hoping to find some of this ash.
