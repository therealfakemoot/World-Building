# Positive Quasielemental Plane of Steam
*Plane information for Positive Quasielemental Plane of Steam*

**Alternate Name:** - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** This plane, despite its name, is surprisingly cool and many believe that calling it Mist would be a better name for it. This mist is clammy and thick, seeping into everything and drenching it completely. While there are pockets of superheated water, it isn’t the biggest danger that travelers should be mindful of, instead, it is drowning on the plane. The mist is so thick and prevalent that every time a creature breathes, they are also breathing in lungfuls of water, choking on flooded lungs.

Steam holds a variety of natural creatures who appeared in the mists of this plane. The most common are the elementals of this plane, though they are incredibly hard to see as they are mist themselves, allowing them to blend into the plane almost seamlessly. The easiest way of locating these elementals is to look for their communities as they constantly trade with the Marids for slaves for unknown purposes. 

Apart from the elementals are the Faberes, gigantic balloonlike creatures who propel themselves through the plane by breathing out gases, the Javoose and Calden, which appear to be large water bugs that flit across the plane in search of food, and the Klyndesi and Wavefires who also appear like steam or mist in strange forms. The Klyndesi are dangerous to outsiders as they hunt the Fabere and travelers, while the Wavefires simply hunt the plane for dry air and don’t bother attacking other creatures.

While this plane is breathable, it is like breathing in heavy fog and mists that fill up your lungs with water. The only way to survive in this plane is if you can naturally breathe in water or air, or you have a _water breathing_ spell cast on you. Many unprepared travelers have drowned on the air of this plane, their lungs so full of water that they burst.
