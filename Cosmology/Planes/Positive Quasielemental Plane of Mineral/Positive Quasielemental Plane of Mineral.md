# Positive Quasielemental Plane of Mineral
*Plane information for Positive Quasielemental Plane of Mineral*

**Alternate Name:** - 
**Alignment:** All
**Inhabitants:** Mephits

**Description:** Thought of as the treasure trove of the multiverse, the plane is made up of brilliant gems, ores, rubies, sapphires, gold, and more with veins of pure metals wrapped around each other like tree roots. Because this plane represents the positive energy of the Plane of Earth, it is filled with the positive minerals and materials with pure metal and gems of the finest quality. Despite how easy it is to find such valuable goods, this plane isnâ€™t often visited simply due to the deadliness of it all. This world is filled with razor-sharp edges from gems, ore, metals, and more, cutting and slicing any creature that attempts to move through the world more than a few feet.

One of the few quasi-elemental planes with an Archomental, Crystalle, who holds claim over the territories of the plane. The inhabitants of this plane are largely the quasielementals of Mineral, though there are also the Tsnng, a race of crystalline creatures who are renowned for their spellcasting and magic. The inhabitants of the plane are typically only encountered by outsiders when they begin trying to take precious gems and ore from the plane, especially in large scale operations like with teams of miners. The inhabitants are constantly having to protect their plane from outsiders looking to get rich quick, and even fighting off the Xorn who travel to this plane from the Plane of Earth and try to devour everything they find. Strangely, the Dao are allowed to take what they want from this plane and are not hassled or destroyed for their greed, making many believe that the Dao are offering something to the Tsnng and Crystalle that allows them such freedoms.

Like the Plane of Earth, this plane is almost completely filled with minerals occupying almost every space of this plane, though the difference is that it has no limestone or granite filling in the spaces between gems and ore. Air exists in the twisting tunnels, and apart from the deadly razor-sharp edges of this plane, it is easy to survive here.
