# Positive Energy Plane
*Plane information for Positive Energy Plane*

**Alternate Name:**  - 
**Alignment:**  All
**Inhabitants:**  Energons

**Description:** Many travelers don’t expect a plane of life and positive energy to be inherently hostile, but it is because this plane is so full of energy and limitless life that it is so. When a traveler visits this plane, they quickly begin filling up with such brilliant energy that they are blinded by the radiance of the plane. Their body begins filling up on life, healing any cuts, wounds, scars, or other anathemas to life until their body is so full of positive energy that they simply explode out, their body and possessions becoming part of the plane and its radiant energy.

This plane can’t help but exude life and churning energy, overbrimming with radiance, it causes all visitors to flood with such powerful energy that their mortal body is unable to hold it all within until they finally succumb to the pure life of this plane. Only a few creatures can truly claim this plane as their home, even though hundreds of gods claim control over life and healing.

This plane is so full of life and boundless energy of creation that no creature can live here but for a select few. Mortals who travel this plane unprepared explode with life, literally, and their body torn about by the brilliant light of this realm. As black and dark as the Negative Energy Plane, the Positive Energy Plane is just as bright if not brighter - though anywho gaze more than a few seconds into this plane find themselves permanently blind. To gaze upon the energy of creation is too much for even the gods who travel to this plane. 

There are a few outposts on this plane, though they take special precautions and have poured vast wealth into maintaining their fortresses on this plane. The inhabitants are mortals who are studying life and cures to draining afflictions that would end life and energy. It’s said that a hospital of sorts has been set up in a portion of this plane where paladins bring in the most grievously injured and cursed, that the plane might cure them of their ails and restore them back to peak life.

Much like the Negative Energy Plane, this plane holds a mysterious and alien creature known as xag-ya, a sentient being of energy. While no one truly knows anything about these creatures, they know enough to give them a wide berth. These creatures, probably with no ill intent, can simply cause a creature to explode in energy and life, their forms so attuned to this realm that waves of energy roll off of them.

Bursting with energy and life, this plane grants 2d6 hit points per minute spent on the plane. These special hit points first heal any missing hit points and then beginning increasing a creature’s maximum hit points, if this total ever exceeds double their normal hit point maximum, they explode in an orb of light as their body can no longer handle the excessive amount of energy in them. If they leave for another plane with this increased hit points, they slowly fade over 2d10 days or if the creature takes damage. Some warriors, sages, and paladins have been known to take advantage of this plane before going into battle, though they don’t always survive such a dangerous endeavor. To survive this process, a creature must gain access to a positive energy protection spell before arriving on this plane or the spell has no effect as its energy is immediately pulled into the plane. A creature under the effects of the spell do not gain any additional hit points or can benefit from the healing energy of this plane.

Pure, brilliant white light is all that can be seen around a creature. Unless a thick blindfold is pressed tightly against the eyes, a creature will go blind from the radiance, even through squeezed shut eyelids. With a thick blindfold, darkened forms against a brilliant white light can be seen for there is no true darkness on this plane. No darkness, even if cast by powerful magic, can survive. This plane infuses everything with energy, be it a living creature or object. Any objects on a creature stay formed while the creature lives, but as soon as it is let go or the creature dies, the objects overload and disintegrate into pure energy. Even powerful magical artifacts will eventually succumb to this burning radiance.
