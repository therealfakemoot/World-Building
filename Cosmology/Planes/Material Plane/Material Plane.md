# Material Plane
*Plane information for Material Plane*

**Alternate Name:**  Alternate Prime Material
**Alignment:**  All
**Inhabitants:**  Prime Material Races

**Description:** The Prime Material plane (also seen as Prime Material Plane) was the plane in which Toril and the surrounding cosmos existed. The phrase "Prime Material plane," or simply the "Prime," was generally used by beings from other planes in the multiverse (notably Sigil), and "prime" was used by the same beings to refer to the inhabitants of the Material Plane.

Despite different ideologies, most cosmologies all focus on the Material Plane being the center of the Planes and it plays an important part in the planes. From the Material Plane, portals to the Astral Sea or Elemental Chaos can be stumbled upon. These portals may lead to horrifying locales or fascinating cities. Furthermore, the Material Plane always has weak spots where the Feywild or Shadowfell are closer and may have some influence on its land. There may be land where no living thing can survive, or where rare flowers of the fey can be found.

In my home world of Talia, the gods that inhabit the Astral Sea are always causing problems for mortals and the primordials of the Elemental Chaos are looking for ways to plunge the material world into chaos. By combining the dangers of the planes, you can bring in powerful, otherworldly beings that will shape your world for future campaigns.
