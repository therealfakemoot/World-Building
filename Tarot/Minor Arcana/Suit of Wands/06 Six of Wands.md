They are seeing their better selves reflected in you -- a victory indeed!

### Six of Wands Reversed Meaning

The Six of Wands reversed encourages you to agree to take a leadership role even if it's uncomfortable. Along with the admiration and privileges of a leadership role comes the pressure of people's expectations and a certain lack of privacy. You cannot hold up your good side twenty-four hours a day, so surrender to the reality that you will be more visible and accountable now, warts and all. Adjust your behavior to accommodate this predicament.

Under the circumstances, there is a solid need for a fresh voice and vision -- so make your move. Those around you who are ready for change will support your leadership.
