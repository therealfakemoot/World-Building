This suit, most often called "Wands" and sometimes called "Rods" or "Staves," represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.

The Seven of this suit generally shows a person who is nearly always successful in working his or her will in the world. This is a person who is truly gifted, standing head and shoulders above the rest. This person is sets standards and sets examples that exceed previous conceptions of what is possible.

Beware of conceitedness that can be hinted at by this card. Being successful does not make you invincible, and it does not protect you against errors! Enjoy your "fifteen minutes of fame" and then get back to your tasks, or your head will swell, to the detriment of your ability to succeed again.
