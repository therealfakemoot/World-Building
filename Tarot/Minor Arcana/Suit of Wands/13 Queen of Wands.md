### Queen of Wands Upright Meaning

This suit, most often called "Wands" and sometimes called "Rods" or "Staves," represents initiative, ambition, drive and desire. This is the suit of enterprise and risk-taking.

Traditionally, representing the energy of a Queen, this woman represents the natural manager, whose gift is to inspire teamwork and divvy up tasks. She is the one who sees ensures everything runs smoothly. She'll be sweating in the sun along with her family or crew, inspiring everybody to keep up and supporting morale with her infectious energy.

She is the best kind of manager to have, because she is like a challenging but encouraging mother, who knows you have it in you. She believes in her charges and they work hard to please her. She is not, however, sentimental. Like a good farmer, she views her crops, her animals, even the people who work for her, as necessary resources for the achievement of the higher goal. If any aspect is no longer productive or cost-effective, she can let them go without a second thought. Do not look to her for sympathy.

### Queen of Wands Reversed Meaning

Reveal any hidden agendas before they alienate partners or associates.

The Queen of Wands reversed points to a controlling tendency that is no secret, and the people around you have the insight to perceive what is happening. Don't think your hidden agenda is undetected, and don't deny it if it is brought to light. It's more important that your team members trust you than it is to preserve an image.

### Queen of Wands Advice Position

The Queen of Wands in this position reveals a need to hold your place in the chain of command and respect the hierarchy (at least for now). This may not be a time for you to be at the helm, even if you are motivated by a strong dedication to completing a project or overcoming a challenge.

A perceived deficiency in leadership may make you want to take hold of the reins, but don't do it! Restrain yourself and remain loyal to your higher-ups. Stay focused and energetic. Enthusiastically confront the challenges directly in front of you. Perform in good faith and encourage others to do the same.
