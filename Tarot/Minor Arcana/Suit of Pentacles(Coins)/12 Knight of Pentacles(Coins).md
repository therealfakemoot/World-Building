UPRIGHT:

### Knight of Pentacles/Coins Upright Meaning

This card is usually called The Knight, but in some modern decks appears as the Prince. Traditionally, this card in this suit pictures an overseer of fertility and growth. His period of ascendancy is during the quiet years between conflicts, when everybody can collaborate in raising the collective standard of living. His horse is usually huge and thickset, more suitable to pulling a plow than riding swiftly into battle. His temperament is easygoing and relaxed, he's moving at the rate of the flow, because he knows that you can't hurry time.

Seeing the bigger picture, like a farmer planning for the future, he doesn't allow momentary fads or fancies to distract him, and he doesn't take seriously those who do. One can feel his stability and dedication -- he is totally responsible and even somewhat predictable when it comes to his projects. He is earthy and gentle, as simple and deep as the soil he tills and the flowers he loves.

### Knight of Pentacles/Coins Reversed Meaning

The Knight of Coins reversed suggests that you should stop wasting energy on people who can't appreciate you. Stop throwing good money after bad.

Cease wasting your blood, sweat and tears on enterprises dominated by people who can't appreciate you. In this instance, you would benefit the whole situation by moving on instead of being so loyal and true.

### Knight of Pentacles/Coins Advice Position

When the Knight of Coins (in some decks, The Prince) falls in this position you are being advised to offer up your services to some project or enterprise in front of you. Your willing participation can make the difference between a marginal performance and a great one.

The entire endeavor will be enhanced significantly by the resources you bring to it and you will be blessed tenfold. Expect to supervise and guide the project as well as influence the outcome of events. Without you on board, this endeavor is just another good idea.
