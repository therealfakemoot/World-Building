### Six of Pentacles/Coins Upright Meaning

This suit, most often named "Coins" or "Pentacles", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.

The Six of this suit is the card of patronage -- generosity with strings attached. The picture shows a rich man giving alms, his reputation enhanced from his giving, but without having helped anybody really better him or herself. Sometimes there is an inference that the giver will be expecting something back for his giving, perhaps sexual favors.

Sometimes this card is interpreted as referring to some kind of patron or benefactor who rescues a talented person from oblivion, but then wants to dictate what the artist works on as his fame grows. Inequality of power is generally a factor in this card, and the person being helped needs to be careful not to trade off heart and soul for a shortcut to fame or fortune. Each player in this scenario needs to examine the possibility they are taking one side or the other in an unbalanced power struggle.

### Six of Pentacles/Coins Reversed Meaning

The Six of Coins reversed suggests that the idea of payback may have become too important to you. The reversal of this card points to someone who is too focused on the idea of getting something back.

You may have postured yourself to look generous, supportive, understanding, but in the fine print you have created so many binding conditions that there is no way anybody can take you up on the offer. Nobody is fooled by such conditional giving.


### Six of Pentacles/Coins Advice Position

The Six of Coins in this position asks you to think of yourself as a cosmic talent agent, seeking individuals who show a spark or gift. You may help them refine and upgrade their skills to fit a larger context. The outcome is a peer relationship with a sense of mutual regard and admiration.

This is a delicate operation. You have to constantly check your intentions so that you are not expecting something in return. Do not for a minute feel proud about doing someone a favor. In truth what you are doing is paying back an old debt to those who served as your mentors.
