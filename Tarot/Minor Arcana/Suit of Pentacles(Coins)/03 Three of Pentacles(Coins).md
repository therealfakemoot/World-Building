### Three of Pentacles/Coins Upright Meaning

This suit, most often named "Coins" or "Pentacles", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.

The Three is traditionally the card of genius. Here we usually see a master craftsman conferring with his masons on the installation of a beautiful stained-glass window in the cathedral. This designer is often likened to Leonardo da Vinci or Michelangelo, a multi-talented visionary who has no peers in talent or productivity.

The masterwork is being proudly showcased for future generations, as an object of personal and collective pride. On some cards, the genius is portrayed at his studio, alone and burning the midnight oil, in a creative ferment -- driven to draw, paint, invent, or whatever work genius wants to bring into creation. As a subtext to the rewards of genius are the days and weeks of intense concentration it takes to solve the problems that great works entail.

### Three of Pentacles/Coins Reversed Meaning

The Three of Coins reversed suggests that you beware of perfectionism and other subtle forms of egoism. This may be tied to a refusal to share one's gifts and vision with the world.

Perhaps you consider the world not worth it or are afraid that others simply won't care. This is really an indirect form of perfectionism that would have you cut off your nose to spite your face. Remember that acts of genius belong more to the divine inspiration that calls them forth than they do to the personalities they come through.

### Three of Pentacles/Coins Advice Position

The Three of Coins in this position suggests that you showcase your unique capabilities. Let the world in on who you really are. This is a good time to seek recognition. Once you receive the appreciation you deserve, accept and savor the acknowledgment.

Expect new and exciting offers. When they arrive, accept them graciously. Why hide your light under a bushel? It does not become you to display false modesty. Practice saying to yourself, "Thank you, I accept the compliment" until you learn to fully let in this kind of affirmative grace with ease.
