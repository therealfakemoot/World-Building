### Five of Pentacles/Coins Upright Meaning

This suit, most often named "Coins" or "Pentacles", is a symbol for a magical talisman that represented wealth or potential. This suit represents something supportive that is available to you -- whether it be health, some kind of talent, a material or financial resource.

The Five of this suit is the card of desire and gratification, expressed in classical tradition as flattery and false promises. This card represents both the seducer and the one seduced. There is undeniable excitement in the attraction of opposites; we have all had delightful moments of magnetism with a stranger. However, if promises are only spoken to achieve short-term gratification with no intent of follow-through, or the attraction appears as competition to more fulfilling relationships, the long-term result won't be worth the thrill of the chase.

The appearance of a viable relationship does not always bear out, so don't put anything of real value at risk over an infatuation. Since the suit here is Coins, this is as likely to be related to business as to pleasure. Try to remove the influence of glamour from your thinking.

Note: In the English decks, like the Rider-Waite, the sickly poor freezing outside a well lit church warn of the painful outcomes of bad choices, rather than focusing on the dynamic tension of the choosing itself.

### Five of Pentacles/Coins Reversed Meaning

The Five of Coins reversed suggests that you should take a hard look at a situation and root out possible deceptions. Perhaps you are being deceived or you are the one deceiving others (or yourself).

There may be a part of you that's so eager to believe in fairy tales or rescue fantasies, that you would fail to check the fine print or a would-be savior's credentials. It's time to start asking the hard questions. If you can't bring yourself to do that, then you cannot succeed in this situation.
