Traditionally, the Three of Swords signified separation or the breakup of a significant relationship, including the tragic emotions that come along with such an event. Some cards show the horizon filled with storm clouds and flashing lightning.

The positive side of this card would be the ending of draining or frustrating associations, to become free again. One message this card brings is to cut some things loose. In spite of sentimental memories and emotional attachments, we need to let go of relationships that either cannot live up to their promise or have outlived the pleasure and support we once found in them.

### Three of Swords Reversed Meaning
