### Four of Cups Upright Meaning

The suit often named Cups is also referred to as Chalices or Hearts. It represents the emotional and psychic aspects of life -- fantasy, imagination, feelings, love.

A Four in this suit refers to a restless time, where a person may have become dissatisfied with life, and emotionally uncomfortable. Feeling stagnated, longing for change, the heart ponders its options ... as it should.

### Four of Cups Reversed Meaning

The Four of Cups reversed indicates that you may not be making the reasons for some reluctance you are feeling clear to yourself or others. Some part of you is resisting the flow of events, but you are not admitting your own part in this.

It may be manifesting as a sort of foot-dragging or unmotivated, passive-aggressive stalling. Recognize this mood as a symptom of a deeper dissatisfaction and come clean to yourself about your real feelings. There is something to be learned.

### Four of Cups Advice Position

The Four of Cups in this position wants you to take a clear look at how stalled or distracted you have become. You may have been bogged down by negativity, hopelessness or a sense of limitation. It is not to your advantage, however, to see the world through such a narrow lens. Cut through some of the forces that undermine you, causing you to feel incapable. Sometimes you have to define what you are "for" by defining what you are "against." Decide that you are not as heavy as the cup of earth, not placid as is the cup of water, not turbulent as is the cup of air. Rather, now may be the time to be as aroused as is the cup of fire. This arousal may constitute liberation from the circumstances that may have brought you here.
