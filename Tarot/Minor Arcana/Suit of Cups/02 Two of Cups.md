### Two of Cups Upright Meaning

The Two in this suit signifies a union of souls. This card traditionally describes a romantic relationship, but also includes the idea that all good friendships and partnerships are based on a natural affinity and a deep mutual understanding. As a personal reflection, it can also signify that your mind and your soul are discovering each other, maybe for the first time.

This card also symbolizes a karmic tie, often portrayed by a wreath or figure-eight ribbon twining around the two cups. Occasionally you see a symbol referring to the union of alchemical opposites (as in sacred sex), pictured as a long-necked flask twined with serpents, its mouth spouting flames, sometimes with wings. This image is from Alchemy, indicating the refining and mutually completing effect of a true and lasting love.

### Two of Cups Reversed Meaning

The Two of Cups reversed indicates that you may be investing too much in a relationship. Sometimes this is a signal that you must stop seeking so much validation from others.

It may be that your attentiveness to those around you has overtaxed your psyche, and you have started neglecting yourself as a result. Stop conforming to the demands or narrow criteria of your partner or partners. When you undermine yourself in this way, you undermine your relationships too. You may think you are working extra hard to take care of others, but you are actually abandoning yourself. Eventually that will lead to alienation and resentment.

### Two of Cups Advice Position

The Two of Cups in this position advises you to speak your heart. It may be likely that the person you are trying to connect with feels the same. Still the other needs to hear this more fully. So why not make it clear and why not now?

The Two of Cups is the image of the heart making a vow. This card advises that you pledge yourself to this friendship and put your heart on the line. You have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Life is a relationship game. It's a great privilege to share with others who are so complementary and compatible.
