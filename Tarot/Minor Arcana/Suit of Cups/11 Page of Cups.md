### Page of Cups Upright Meaning

This card is traditionally entitled the Page, but in some modern decks appears as a Princess. In this suit this card represents a poetic, mystical, emotionally open young person, still tender and idealistic, given to flights of imaginative fantasy.

This energy is exquisitely refined and fine-tuned. It may be that a sense of being grounded in reality has not yet entirely set in, such that he or she is easily tossed about by external forces and events. This person must work to achieve a stronger will and a more calculating mind, to balance and protect all that wonderful sensitivity.

### Page of Cups Reversed Meaning

When the Page of Cups card is reversed it suggests that those around this Page, or Princess, have been tolerant of his or her self-indulgent feelings. In reality, they don't owe you this service.

If you impinge upon their good nature too much, you may be unpleasantly surprised by the results. Be sure you start making their desires and well-being a higher priority.

### Page of Cups Advice Position

The Page of Cups (in some decks, a Princess) in this position advises you to study the best ways to be of service. Strive to discern what would give more pleasure, comfort and emotional security. Then, provide it. Understand that what is happening has little or nothing to do with you personally. The best you can do is to offer support and listen closely.

Make sure you understand what is needed and serve the situation with loyalty. Look at individuals around you as the embodiment of the Divine, and try to fulfill each one's needs. Be unconcerned with the outcome. Later you will understand why you needed to be in this position.
