### Seven of Cups Upright Meaning

The Seven of this suit typically refers to works of the imagination, the use of dream and vision to invent a future different than the life one is currently living. This card reminds us that our outcomes are not set in stone.

We can raise our hopes and expectations and upgrade our results. Do not be fooled by the title Fantasy which this card is sometimes given -- this card indicates the truly magical quality of awakened imagination.

### Seven of Cups Reversed Meaning

The Seven of Cups reversed reminds you to reawaken to playfulness, joy and curiosity. Perhaps a lack of purpose is having a deadening effect. It's almost as if it is saying that you have forgotten how to dream. As a result, mind and imagination can become dry as a desert where only the harsh light of material reality can penetrate. In such a case, there is no golden glow, there is no higher purpose or magic spark.

This is a state of mind that no one should tolerate for long. Find something that restimulates your endorphins -- whether taking a long walk and breathing deep, buying a bouquet of roses and lilies for your kitchen table, or making contact (perhaps through art or meditation) with something good, true and beautiful. Take that step immediately and relieve yourself of the deadening flatness.

### Seven of Cups Advice Position

The Seven of Cups in this position advises that you relax your mind and open to the dreams and imaginings your inner child loves to entertain. Allow yourself to imagine a truly positive outcome for this situation. Perform an exercise in creative visualization by relaxing your guard and letting go of your fears.

As the dreamscape unfolds, your electro-magnetic chemistry is stimulated to a point of achieving greater confidence in yourself and in what you are doing. Even if it's only a temporary break from your fears, this is a helpful exercise because it gives your psyche and body a dose of unlimited thinking and optimism. Think positively -- the results could truly be amazing.
