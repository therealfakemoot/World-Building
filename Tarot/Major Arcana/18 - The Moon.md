card: The Moon
synopsis: 
---
The Moon card is greatly connected to your subconscious. It represents the thoughts, feelings, doubts and fears that you carry internally. When The Moon arises in your Tarot reading, you may be feeling anxious, allowing these fears to override the memories of your past and your faith in the future. Do not be deceived -- you can't believe everything that you see, hear ... or think. If you can draw these feelings to the surface and address them, you can rid yourself of worry.

### THE MOON DESCRIPTION

The Moon card shows a full moon in the nightâ€™s sky, positioned between two large towers. The Moon is a symbol of intuition, dreams, and the unconscious. Its light is dim compared to the sun, and only slightly illuminates the path to higher consciousness winding between the two towers.

In the foreground is a small pool, representing the watery, subconscious mind. A small crayfish crawls out of the pool, symbolizing the early stages of consciousness unfolding. A dog and a wolf stand in the grassy field, howling at the moon, representing both the tamed and the wild aspects of our minds.
