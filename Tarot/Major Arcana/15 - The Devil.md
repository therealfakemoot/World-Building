card: The Devil
synopsis: 
---
The Devil card carries heavy feelings of restraint and powerlessness. When he comes up in your Tarot reading, you are likely feeling like you have no control and are stuck in a situation you don't want to be in. The Devil has convinced you that you have no options, but this couldn't be further from the truth. You are not being trapped by external forces, but by your own limitations or unwillingness to move forward. You hold the keys to your own freedom, but it's up to you to open the lock.

### THE DEVIL DESCRIPTION

The Devil card shows Baphomet, or the Horned Goat of Mendes, a creature that is half man, half goat. Baphomet originally represented the balance between good and evil, male and female, and human and animal; however, more recently, this figure has been linked to the occult and has become a scapegoat for all things considered ‘evil’.

The Devil has the wings of a vampire bat, an animal that sucks the lifeblood out of its prey, symbolic of what happens when you give in to your raw desires. He has a hypnotic stare which ‘magnetizes’ and entrances those who come near him, bringing them under his power. Above him is an inverted pentagram – a sign of the darker side of magic and occultism. He raises his right hand in the Vulcan Salute – a Jewish blessing, later made famous by the film series, Star Trek. In his left hand, he holds a lit torch.

At the foot of The Devil stand a man and a woman, both naked and chained to the podium on which The Devil sits. They appear to be held here against their will – but look closer, and you will notice that the chains around their necks are loose and could be easily removed. Each has small horns on their head, like the devil’s, a sign that they are becoming increasingly like him the longer they stay here. Both have tails, a further symbol of their animalistic tendencies and raw instincts, and the grapes and the fire on their respective tails signify pleasure and lust.
