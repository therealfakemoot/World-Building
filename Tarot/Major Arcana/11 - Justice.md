Justice is your firm-but-fair reminder that karma is real, and there is a consequence for every action. Whatever life is handing you at this moment comes from decisions you've made in the past, and whether it's a punishment or a reward, it is exactly what you deserve. When this card comes up in your Tarot reading, make sure you are acting fairly in all your interactions with others.

### JUSTICE DESCRIPTION

The figure of Justice sits in front of a loosely hung purple veil, signifying compassion, and between two pillars, similar to those framing The High Priestess and The Hierophant, which symbolize balance, law and structure.

She holds a sword in her right hand, showing the logical, well-ordered mindset necessary to dispense fair justice. The sword points upwards – expressing a firm and final decision – and the double-edged blade signifies that our actions always carry consequences. The scales in her left (intuitive) hand, show intuition must balance that logic and are a symbol of her impartiality. Justice wears a crown with a small square on it representing well-ordered thoughts, and a red robe with a green mantle. A little white shoe pops out from beneath her clothing as a reminder of the spiritual consequences of your actions.
