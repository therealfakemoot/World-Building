---
The Hanged Man is a card that comes up when you are in limbo. He tells you that sometimes small sacrifices must be made in order to benefit the bigger picture. When The Hanged Man arises in your reading, you likely want to make a move, but don't even know where to begin. Begin by letting go. Lightening your grip on something that's no longer working for you or detaching from the outcome of your situation can help you release yourself.

### THE HANGED MAN DESCRIPTION

The Hanged Man shows a man suspended from a T-shaped cross made of living wood. He is hanging upside-down, viewing the world from a completely different perspective, and his facial expression is calm and serene, suggesting that he is in this hanging position by his own choice. He has a halo around his head, symbolizing new insight, awareness and enlightenment. His right foot is bound to the tree, but his left foot remains free, bent at the knee and tucked in behind his right leg. His arms are bent, with hands held behind his back, forming an inverted triangle. The man is wearing red pants representing human passion and the physical body, and a blue vest for knowledge. The Hanged Man is the card of ultimate surrender, of being suspended in time and of martyrdom and sacrifice to the greater good.
