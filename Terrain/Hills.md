# Hills
A hill is a peak of land above sea level, like a mountain, but lower and not as steep. These geological formations can be formed by erosion or deposition of sediment. These areas can be grassy, or covered in trees, or devoid of vegetation as in a desert. Hills often fill the transition between flatter plains and rougher mountain areas. Note that there may well be some dispute between geographers and inhabitants as to whether a given terrain feature is a hill or a mountain.
