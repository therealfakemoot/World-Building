> **Description:** This rare tree can grow up to 20 m tall, and can become quite old. It has dark red wood, and equally dark blue leaves. The flowers, which grow in small bunches, are startling white, almost radiant. Its nuts have a very special property; each nut raises the Intelligence or Wisdom (determine randomly) of the eater by 0.1 point (20 max). The effect lasts for a whole week, after which it fades again, although there is a 10% chance the effect is permanent. Around the tree there are often animals (squirrels, salmon) who eat the nuts on a regular basis, and are therefore quite intelligent, often possessing speech or even (GMs discretion) spellcasting abilities. The number of nuts available varies greatly, depending on the age of the tree, the amount of creatures aware of its existence, etc, and mainly of course on the GMs wishes. Basically, the GM should determine how many of the players you wish to profit from it, multiply by ten, and make up an explanation as to why there are no more nuts.
