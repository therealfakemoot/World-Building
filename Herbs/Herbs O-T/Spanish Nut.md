> **Description:** This herb is a powerful aphrodisiac. If successfully administered I would suggest that the GM or player roleplays the recipient accordingly. However if a method of using dice to simulate its effect is wanted, I suggest that anyone who attempts to seduce the recipient should have a bonus of 1d4 to their Charisma (Appearance) for a period of 2d10 turns.
