> **Description:** This dark-colored root grows on a plant distinguished by its waxy dark green leaves. When the root is boiled down, it turns into a thick, strong-smelling greyish liquid that cures congestion when boiled in water and inhaled. (Relieves stuffy head, opens sinuses, for as long as the steam is breathed + 2d6x10 rounds.)
