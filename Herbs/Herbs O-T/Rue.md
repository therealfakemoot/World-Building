> **Description:** Rue is a small rounded bush which grows to about three feet in height. It has yellow, scoop like flowers. The leaves are shaped like spades, and are blue grey in colour. It has seedpods which resemble a small green orange. The seedpods should be consumed as an antidote to ingested poisons. Provided it is taken within 10 minutes, of the poison being ingested, and the poison has not already had its effect, it will neutralise the poison in 1d4 minutes, on a successful herbalism check. It is also mixed with wormwood to create a very effective antiseptic. See Wormwood for details.
