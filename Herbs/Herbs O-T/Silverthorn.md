> **Description:** Silverthorn is a small thorny plant, white in colour with red berries and silver thorns. Called aelebera by the elves, this herb can function either as a poison or as an antidote to itself. It is found only by one lake located high in the mountains. For use as a poison the thorns must be crushed and boiled in oil over the course of a night, at which point, the resultant mixture may be smeared on the end of a weapon. When the weapon pierces its target, the poison will take effect killing the victim within 2d6 hours. There is no save and no cure, except for the antidote outlined below. Not even the most powerful magic can cure this poison. The only cure for this poison, is also made from the Silverthorn plant. The berries must be boiled in absolutely pure water, contained in a pure silver vessel, and the resultant mixture stored in a vial of absolutely pure glass until use. The liquid must be placed on the dying victims lips, where within 1d20 minutes, they will recover from the poisoning.
