> **Description:** A rugged thorny plant found by the sea. The leaves must be boiled for two hours in salt water, and the resultant mix sweetened with honey. This mixture will act as a cure for certain types of ingested poisons (GMs discretion, as to which ones). The recipient must be made to drink one dose immediately the mixture is ready, and then a further dose every twelve hours for three days (7 doses in all). If the number of successful applications is four or more, the patient will recover.
