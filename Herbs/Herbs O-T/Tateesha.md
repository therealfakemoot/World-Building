> **Description:** The tateen bush is a low lying shrub with long thin leaves and small brown nuts. These nuts may be chewed to provide a short lived feeling of euphoria, and are mildly addictive. They have the side effect of staining the teeth, making it easy to find a tateen addict. The flowers, called silks bloom only in spring, and if gathered and dried for one week form a powerful narcotic which may be smoked. For 2d10 minutes after smoking the persons insight is increased (+1 to Intelligence), but for 1d4 hours after this, a state of distortion ensues and the recipient Intelligence and Wisdom drop by 2 from their normal levels. Prolonged use causes the user to collapse into an almost dreamlike trance. THIS HERB IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. REPEATED USE IS VERY UNWISE.
