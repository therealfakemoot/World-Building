> **Description:** Scented mayweed grows to a height of about 2 feet. It has erect and branching stems. It has small leaves, white flowers with a yellow centre. The flowers must be crushed, emitting a pungent odour and should then be applied to the eyes in order to heal damage to them caused by acid. If used within a day of the injury, they can prevent blindness.
