> **Description:** Tephrosia consists of a small woody stem, with fern like leaves along its length, and topped by several small flowers (or in summer seedpods). Either the flowers or the seeds may be boiled in water and then drunk to calm the recipient. This is very useful when a person is delirious, or otherwise insane. It also has a mild pain relieving effect and may be given to the wounded or injured. The seedpods are more effective than the flowers (hence the different ability checks) and may also be dried. This herb is mildly addictive and should be used with care.
