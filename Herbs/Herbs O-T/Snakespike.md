> **Description:** A thin stalk covered with yellow-green flowers. The leaves can be steeped in water to make a tea that, when imbibed 3 times a day, reduces inflammation and restores strength; when made into an ointment, snakespike soothes and promotes rapid healing. (Tea gives 1d3 hp/day instead of 1; ointment restores 1d2 hp immediately per application but can only be administered to the same character once a day.)
