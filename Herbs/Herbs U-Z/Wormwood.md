> **Description:** The effects of this herb last for two hours. During this time the character can function at negative hit points, or beyond the point of exhaustion. Wormwood normally grows to about four feet in height. It has a stiff and angular stem, reddish brown in colour. It has deeply incised smooth leaves which are silvery white with a slight tinge of green. It has small, yellow-green flowers arranged in long spikes at the top of the stem. The herbs is also a rather effective insect repellent and is often left with clothing to keep fleas away. It also makes a very effective antiseptic when mixed with rue (Intelligence check to remove all infection from a wound within 5d6 hours). In addition to its above effects wormwood is also a prime ingredient in a very dangerous, very addictive drink called Absinthe which is milky green in colour. I will not outline the manufacture of this drink as it is highly dangerous, and often illegal. THIS HERB IN ANY FORM IS HIGHLY ADDICTIVE. REPEATED USE IS VERY UNWISE.
