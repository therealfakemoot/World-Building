> **Description:** Young lad's love is a 3 to five foot tall shrub with many branches that resemble small trees. It has small yellow- white flowers, and green feathery leaves, which smell of lemon. These leaves turn a rich orange-brown in late autumn. The flowers should be crushed and placed into a poultice, to be used. A successful application will cure one small area of frostbite, such as a foot or hand, in 2d8 hours.
