> **Description:** A wide-leafed plant with large pink flowers and thick roots containing a slimy gel. When the root is pulped, mixed with water and used as a poultice, it is effective against fresh burns, aiding rapid healing. The root-gel can also be thinned and drunk as a thick tea to counter the effects of blood loss. (On burns, add 2 hp/day for each of the first 3 days of rest the character takes. Used to counter blood loss, victim regains 1d3 hp/day instead of 1.)
