> **Description:** This 25 cm high plant has many broad, double sawed leaves growing in a rosette. It grows large, yellow composite flowers, which will quickly grow hairy seeds that will fly far on the wind. The plant often has flowers and seed simultaneously. If a generous amount of the leaves is fed to a horse or similar creature, it will be able to travel all day without tiring, even if moving at a gallop.
