> **Description:** This 30 cm high plant has 3 thick, fleshy leaves, dark green and covered with soft hairs. The leaves form a rosette, lying on the ground, and form the actual plant. The light green blades that account for its hight are actually sheathes from which flower stalks grow during the summer. From each of the sheathes (there can be as many as 30 to a plant), a single flower stalk grows with tiny purple flowers. The thick leaves, which can become as large as 20 cm across, can be torn loose and put inside your boots (One leaf to a boot), enabling you to walk all day without tiring or even getting footsore.
