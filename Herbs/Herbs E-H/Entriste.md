> **Description:** A small-leafed ivy that hugs the ground. Entriste's leaves absorb liquid and, when crushed, may be used to draw poison from a wound. (1 leaf absorbs a quarter-pint of liquid. Causes 1d4 damage but draws 100% of poison from a wound if applied within 5 rounds of insinuative poisoning, -25% for each round thereafter. Does not work against gases or "instant-death" poisons.  Most poison effects are weakened if the poison is at least partially removed.)
