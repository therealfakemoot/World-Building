> **Description:** Fennel has thick stems, and bright green, lacy leaves and routinely grows to about five feet in height. (There is a rare form which has a bronze stem. In terms of its use, it is identical to the common fennel). In summer it has golden, yellow flowers. These flowers turn to seed in early Autumn. The seed heads must be harvested and left until the seeds separate from them. The seeds may then be mixed with boiling water to make a tea. This tea has the effect of relieving hunger pains in the recipient for 2d8 hours, However it does not in anyway act as a substitute for food, and any damage due to starvation will still occur.
