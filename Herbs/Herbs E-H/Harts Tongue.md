> **Description:** This fern resembles a deer's tongue, hence its name. When a single frond is eaten, it serves to immediately decrease the recipients libido for 2d4 days. For this reason it is often of value to those undertaking a vow of celibacy, or who must be away from their loved ones. It does not diminish performance in any way, merely desire.
