> **Description:** This is a green plant with small red flower, which are renowned for their healing properties. These flowers can be eaten fresh or dried for later use. If not dried they will become useless within 1 week. The flowers can also be brewed over a very low heat in fresh water to produce a `potion', which cane be drunk for its healing effect. When consumed, the herb will, on a successful herbalism check, heal 6 hp damage with fresh leaves, 4 hp using dry leaves, and 6 - 8 hp using the brew.
