> **Description:** A blue-grey herb smelling faintly of nutmeg that heightens the user's senses. Overdosage or prolonged usage causes photosensitivity, distraction and nervousness; on the other hand, prolonged usage can also make the effects permanent. Nightcall gradually dyes the long-term user's hair, teeth, nails, horns, or scales midnight blue.  (The minimum dose of 1 tsp gives the eater +100' sight range, +10% hearing, and +1 to Wisdom/Intuition and Dexterity scores.  The effects increase proportionately to the dosage, to no more than +400/40/+4.  Dosages over 1 tsp, or 1 tsp taken several days in a row, will cause addiction.)
