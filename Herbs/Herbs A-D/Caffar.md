> **Description:** Caffar is made of the small caffar nut that is ground into a powder and brewed into a dark, sweet-smelling beverage, traditionally with a goat's milk base. Like kaffe or black tea, caffar can be used to delay sleep, but it has the side effect of making the ingester more psychically sensitive; psionicists' skills are greatly enhanced and even the unpsyighted are more sensitive to nuances in the environment and in others' manners, sometimes even to the point of detecting "auras" around certain objects. (Raises Wisdom [Intuition] by 1 for every 2 cups imbibed, to maximum of 19. Drinking 3-4 cups in one day causes jumpiness that increases as more is imbibed.  Those who drink 5 or more cups in one day become slightly physically addicted to the substance and suffer headaches and mild stomach pains when their usage is cut back.)
