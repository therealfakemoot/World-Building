> **Description:** Agrimony reaches a height of 1 to 2 feet. It has leaves up to seven inches long, which are serrated, green on top and white underneath. It has yellow flowers with five petals which are arranged in a spike on top of the stem. Its dried leaves must be boiled in a pint of red wine for five minutes, and then left to stand for an hour. It should then be used on sprains and bruises in a compress. A successful application will cure sprains and bruises in half the normal time. Agrimony was also believed to produce very heavy sleep if placed beneath a persons head, so deep that the person could not be woken until it was removed. At the GMs discretion agrimony may have this effect, but I would suggest the potential victim gets a save vs poison with a very large (8-10) bonus.
