> **Description:** The Barberry plant has sharp thorns on its twigs. It can obtain a height in excess of eight feet. It has roughly oval shaped leaves, which are smooth with toothed edges. It has pale yellow flowers which produce oval red berries, with a small black dot at their tip. Barberries should be ground up in cold water and be left to stand in cold water, and then boiled quickly. This mixture should be drunk as a cure for liver disorders such as jaundice. If successfully administered the cure should take effect within two weeks. However three failed applications mean that there is never any hope of cure by this method.
