> **Description:** This rush grows in small grassy clumps. It can grow from about 2 to 6 feet in height and has very small yellow green flowers that jut out from the stem. The leaves are long, thin and light green in colour and smells faintly sweet. The root is white with a red brown peel. The root must be peeled and boiled in fresh water within a day of being picked, and should then be drunk by the recipient. Provided no permanent physical damage has been done to the person hearing organs, the herb may restore some small measure of hearing to a totally deaf person, perhaps 10% of normal hearing. In addition the herb has been reported to have aphrodisiac qualities (GMs discretion) and was used by certain Native American peoples to make their dogs fierce.
