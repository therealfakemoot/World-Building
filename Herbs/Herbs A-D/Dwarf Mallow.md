> **Description:** This small plant has a single primary stem from which other, shorter stems ending either with leaves or with small pick flowers. These flowers when crushed and mixed with honey and salt into a poultice will relieve the pain of bee stings on a successful application. In addition the crushed flower may be mixed with oil and smothered onto the body in which case, no bees will approach for 1d4 + 2 hours. At the GMs discretion, this effect may extend to other small insects.
