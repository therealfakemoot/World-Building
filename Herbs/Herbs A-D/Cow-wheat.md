> **Description:** Cow wheat is a small straight stemmed yellow-green plant. Its pale yellow flowers produce a white powder when crushed, between two hands. If this powder is placed into food or drink it will cause a person to act as if drunk. For those who desire game mechanics to deal with drunkenness, please consult the Intoxication Table in the 1st Edition AD&D DMG, page 82. Each dose of this herb successfully administered will increase the level of drunkenness by one step.
