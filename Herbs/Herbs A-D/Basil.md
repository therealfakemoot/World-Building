>#  Basil

> **Locale:** Rural

> **Preparation:** none
> **Description:** Basil must be used almost immediately on being picked. The leaves should be applied to the bite of a venomous creature, and it will then have the effect of drawing out the poison. It will give a bonus of +4 to the saving throw vs poison, or if the save has already been made and failed, it will allow a second saving throw at normal values. Any damage already sustained will remain. The herb has one upright stalk, and small white flowers.
