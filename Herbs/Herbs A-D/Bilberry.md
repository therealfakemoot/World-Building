> **Description:** Bilberries are small black berries. They must be mixed with pure alcohol and left to stand for fifteen days, at the end of which time they must be drunk. A successful application will give a human the same infravision ability as half elves, but a failed application may lead to the death (save penalty -4) of the person who drinks it, as if they had drunk a class J poison (Death/ 20 hit points, onset 1d4 minutes).
