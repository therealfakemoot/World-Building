> **Description:** Asarabacca is a creeping vine with many small leaves each on their own small stalk. It also has small purple flowers. These flowers must be brewed up on a fire and left to stand. When administered successfully to someone, they must save vs poison or be rendered docile, and incapable of violence for 3d8 hours. The brew has a distinctive purple colour, and bitter taste, so to be given secretly in food, the food must be able to hide these attributes.
